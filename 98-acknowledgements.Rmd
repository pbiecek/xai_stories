This project is inspired by a fantastic book [Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods](https://compstat-lmu.github.io/iml_methods_limitations/) created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich. We used the LIML project as cornerstone for this reopsitory.

This book would not have been written without openness to cooperation of three Warsaw universities: Warsaw University of Technology, University of Warsaw and SGH Warsaw School of Economics. Students from these three universities collaborated (remotely due to the Covid-19 epidemic) on their chapters.

My biggest thanks go to two people from McKinsey, who have been supporting my classes on UoW and WUT for years, inspiring it with ideas for new challenges, ideas and solutions.
