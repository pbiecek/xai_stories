This book is the result of a student projects for [Interpretable Machine Learning](https://github.com/pbiecek/InterpretableMachineLearning2020) course at the University of Warsaw and the Warsaw University of Technology. Each team has prepared one case study for selected XAI technique.

This project is inspired by a fantastic book [Limitations of Interpretable Machine Learning Methods](https://compstat-lmu.github.io/iml_methods_limitations/) created at the Department of Statistics, LMU Munich.
We used the LIML project as the cornerstone for this repository.

The book chapters are written in the Markdown language.
The simulations, data examples and visualizations were created with R [@rlang] and Python.
The book was compiled with the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) package.
We collaborated using [github repository](https://github.com/pbiecek/xai_stories).
